_Under the AilurusLabs Study Projects (Java)_

By Gabriel Virrey (first published 2025-11-10)

Gabe's first REST API, made with Spring Boot Webflux, R2DBC, and a lot of guidance from Google Gemini's **Guided Learning** mode.

This repository serves as a training ground for our upcoming final project in our 2nd year course, COMP 009, *Object-Oriented Programming* (in Java) of the BSCS program at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Manila.

## Prerequisites:

* Java 21 or newer

  This project uses the latest RELEASE of Spring Boot from [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) as of the time of writing, with Java 21 set as its target.
